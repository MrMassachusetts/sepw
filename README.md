# sepw
Social Engineering Password-Generator
A passwordlist generator, which uses information about a person

INSTALLING:

git clone https://github.com/MrMassachusetts/sepw/

START:

cd sepw

python3 sepw.py

USAGE:

If you use the guided program, the program will ask you questions about the victim, which you'll have to answer. If you don't know the answer to a question, simply leave it blank. If the questions are finished you can add your own keywords. Seperate them by pressing enter. If you want to generate the list enter 'EXIT' and specify a filename, WITH a file-extension.

If you use the manual program you just need to enter the keywords, seperate them by pressing enter. If you type 'EXIT' you'll just need to specify a filename and your file will be generated.
